### This is the first time I have been writing up a blog and have been thinking about to work upon it for a really long time. Finally took some time to write one. initially I was skeptical of the fact that what should I write upon. Should it be the things I daily work on or the things I like such as politics or economics(I'm no expert on either of the topics!)
