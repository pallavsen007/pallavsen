## The Foreign Exchange

The fan was swinging to its full extent, when Heinrich Wilmut and Abhinash
Borah sharing one cigarette in their University hostel, Heinrich breached on the
topic of the most attractive girl of their class saying “Where is Subasna from?” 
mispronouncing her name(“Xubaxhona”) every time in his Austro-German accent.
Abhinash replied curtly, “Diphu”. Heinrich took the last puff and discarded the 
remains in the makeshift ashtray of an old cup, and said thoughtfully, “I must meet
her”.

Much to his class-friends’ astonishments, Heinrich was a carefree guy, roaming
around the streets of Tezpur all alone bargaining with the vendors of Chowk
Bazaar. Yes! It was not even a month he had landed in Indian soil from Austria, he
learned the art of bargaining even though the language barrier was there, and hand
gestures were enough for them to strike a deal. And on these Sunday outings, he
always used to go to Ganesh Ghat after shopping for retreat every time using
Navigation app to locate it.

It was only about a few weeks in the university, he already felt homesick and was
longing back to go back Graz, his hometown. He was on a foreign exchange
program to the university. He took a flight from Graz to London, and then from
London to New Delhi and from New Delhi to Tezpur by train. It really was an
excruciating journey; he never had travelled so far in his 24 years of life.

He didn’t strike any considerable friendship with anyone leaving his roommate
though he was always busy with his fanatic computer games. One day when he and
Abhinash were in their room after dinner, Heinrich said, “I want to make friends
with Subasna, I like the way she does her hairs but every time I try to greet her to
have a small chat, she finds some excuse or other to abandon it”. Abhinash was
well aware of the culture of that part of the world from where Heinrich belonged
and was also aware that he knew nothing of Indian or Assamese culture. Abhinash
was quite sure of the fact that much of Heinrich’s assumptions of India and Assam
were based on few Bollywood movies he had watched back in Graz. Abhinash
tried to console him by saying that “This is India man! Moreover this is Assam!
Here people of opposite genders do not socialize that often unless they’re married
or in some way related to one other. Let’s hope she runs out of excuses and spend
some time with you”.

The very next day in class, Heinrich tried stealing glances of Xubaxhona and was
making keen observations of her outline. She was dripped in sweat, which he
found to be ecstatic. Her long hairs which were wet, as she didn’t get time to dry
them before class, did the magic spell to him. Her small eyes with lesser eyebrows
unlike most of Indian girl were pleasing him. She had resemblance to women he
had seen in Chinese or Thai movies. It seemed as if his fantasies were coming true.
This Mongoloid girl was driving him crazy. Her name and address reeled through
brain throughout the evening, “Xubaxhona Sonowal from Diphu, Karbi Anglong”

Later that evening, he confessed to his roommate “I want to hold her and keep her
tight by my chest”. To which his friend revolted, “Do you have any idea what you
are saying? It is not possible! Why are you thinking to bring troubles to her and
yourself? She’s a decent girl and hails from a very decent family”. Heinrich
replied, “So what? No one ought to stop their inhibitions. I must confess my
desires to her!” Abhinash unable to persuade his friend mildly protested, “This is
Assam not Austria”.

The next morning when Heinrich reached class late due to a hangover as he had
more beers than his usual quota, he found that most of them were gone. However
to his delight he saw Xubaxhona in much beautiful attire than usual, was coming
towards him. He greeted her “Hey, Subasna how’re you doing? It’s great to see
you, you seem hardly finding any time to have a chat with me”. She said that she
was waiting for him and inquired about what had obsessed him to come late. They
both had a lovely time talking with each other and laughing at each other’s jokes.

Later in the evening, when both Abhinash and Heinrich retired to their room,
Abhinash inquired about the piece of thread in Heinrich’s hand to which Heinrich
showed off to him saying that “See this is what Subasna gave me today, she tied
onto my hands! We both had a lovely time together. I felt like suddenly I had
friend-zoned her”. After listening to Heinrich’s exploits of the day, Abhinash
explained to him that it was the very day of Rakhi Purnima and the event being
called Raksha Bandhan when a sister ties rakhi to her brother, eventually the
brother promising to protect her. Slowly when the real part of the story dawned
upon both of them, they both started laughing to their heart’s content. Heinrich felt
as a brother he ought to protect her by holding her near to his chest.
